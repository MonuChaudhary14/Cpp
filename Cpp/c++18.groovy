    // Inheritance
    // 1. Resuability is a very important feature of oops
    // 2.In C++ we can reuse a class and add additional features to it
    // 3.Reusing classes saves time and money
    // 4.Resuing already tested and debugged class will save a lot of effort of developing and debugging the same thing


    // -->The concept of resuability in C++ is supported using inheritance
    // -->We can reuse the properties of an existing class by inheriting from it
    // -->The existing class is called as the base class
    // -->The new class which is inherited is called as the derived class
    

    // -->Types of inheritance
    // 1.Single inheritance:A derived class with only one base class
    // 2.Multiple inheritance:A derived class with more than one  base class
    // 3.Hierarchical inheritance:Several derived class from a single class
    // 4.Multiple inheritance:A derived class with more than one base class
    // 5.Multilevel inheritance:deriving a class from already derived class
    // 6.Hybrid inheritance:A class derived from  two classes as in multiple inheritance
    // -->Hybrid inheritance is a combination of multiple inheritance and multilevel inheritance
    // -->However, one of the parent class is not a base class
